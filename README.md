# hello-world

Hello, My name is Adam and I am learning how to code through various self-teaching methods.

I am interested in coding in Python, HTML, JavaScript, and maybe C# or C+ whenever I can get around to learning it a little bit more.
This program was made alongside the tutorial of how to get started on here so please excuse my newbiness.
Thank you very much for reading this and I hope to code more programs sometime in the future on this website.
